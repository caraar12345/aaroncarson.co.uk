I have a [**standing invitation**](/contact/standing-invitation) in place for you to send me an email - send me anything and I'll more than happily take a look 😄

Don't expect an instant response however - I have ADHD and I'm also pretty busy.

So my response time is 'best effort' (but I will respond at some point! If it's been more than a week, please send a followup to yell) 😁
