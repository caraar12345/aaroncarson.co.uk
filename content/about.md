Hi! 👋 I’m __Aaron__ (_he/him_).

I'm a __Security Operations Analyst__ at [__Monzo__](https://monzo.com), and I work on my personal projects whenever I get a bit of free time (such as my homelab) 🖥️

This started with my 3 years at Kingston University London, where I completed and received an upper second class degree with honours in Cyber Security and Computer Forensics 🤓🎓

If you’d ever like to get in touch with me for whatever reason, I have a [**standing invitation**](/contact/standing-invitation) open, so please do email me at [__hello@aaroncarson.co.uk__](mailto:hello@aaroncarson.co.uk) ✉️
